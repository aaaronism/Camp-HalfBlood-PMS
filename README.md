## Final Thoughts
I had a really fun time designing out the website. However, along with getting sick, I got stuck on a few spots preventing me from managing my time wisely. I was able to build out the basic CRUD routes but was unable to build out all the ideas I had originally planned due to time restraints. In the future, I will keep a tighter schedule.
